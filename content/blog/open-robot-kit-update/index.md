# Open Robot Kit Update

The Coding to Learn and Create project team is continuing work on the Open Robot Kit.

{{< youtube 6tdjStCo3oM  >}}

New robots are being designed that better meet the needs of diverse learners.
These robots can be put together from easily attainable parts, and will allow people
to customize them to their needs.
We intend to use these robots in workshops planned for early next year.
