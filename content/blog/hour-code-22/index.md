Two new activities were added to the Weavly Educator's Toolkit for the event.
Both the
[Drawing Shapes Activity](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/drawing-shapes/) and the
[Creating Patterns Activity](https://weavly.org/learn/activities/creating-patterns/) use the scene of the
[Weavly](https://create.weavly.org/) coding environment as a virtual drawing canvas.
The activities helps learners identify cause and effect, use directional navigation and embrace their creativity.
