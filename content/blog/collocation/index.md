# Joint Exhibition of Beverley School and IDRC

On June 8th and 9th, the Beverley School and the Coding to Learn and Create team held a joint exhibition that showcased the many unique expressions to be found at the intersection of creativity, ability, and diversity.

Through large scale, mixed media artworks, Collocation weaves together the many unique expressions of Beverley's students in a dynamic rhythm of colour, gesture, and texture.

Collocation is the work of the Beverley School community, co-designed and facilitated by TDSB Visual Art Teacher, Hien Quach, and OAC Visual Artist, Patrick Moore.

Creative Path is the celebration of inclusive design with students from across Canada, using Weavly (an inclusive coding environment and coding resources) and Debugâ€™d (a kit including a range of adapted materials and coding curriculum for common robots at schools). Creative Path is a collaboration between IDRC, Bridges Canada, TakingITGlobal, TetraTMU, the Beverley School, and many other schools across Canada.
