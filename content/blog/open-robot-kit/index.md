# Open Robot Kit

Weavly (formerly the Inclusive Coding Environment) is being designed to work with a variety of coding robots. Off the shelf robots are often inaccessible for many learners. This is why Tetra Ryerson is creating an Open Robot Kit to enable educators to easily create a ‘one-size-fits-one’ robot that works with Weavly.

The students are working in groups to create robots that are reasonably affordable, composed of easy to acquire parts, robust and safe enough for students to play with. The robots are designed with composable parts and will have a Robot Building Guide with easy to follow instructions. The guide will be freely available in the Educator’s Toolkit.
