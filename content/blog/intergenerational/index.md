# Intergenerational Coding Workshops

From October through December 2022, the Coding to Learn and Create project worked with the
[GrandPals](https://grandpals.ca/) project and the
[By Design Learning Centre](https://www.bydesignlearning.ca/) to explore intergenerational
activities through a coding perspective. The workshops provided an opportunity for
co-mentorship where the seniors and kids learned from each other while sharing stories and
exchanging life experiences.

A new
[facilitation guide](https://weavly.org/learn/resources/facilitating-intergenerational-coding-workshops/)
for running intergenerational coding workshops is now available in the Weavly Educator's
Toolkit
