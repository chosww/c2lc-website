# Co-Designing Weavly

{{< youtube 9VHxRrkuYzc >}}

The Weavly coding environment is being designed and built through a 4 year collaboration with children who have complex disabilities, their parents, teachers, and caregivers.

We brought existing tools, coding environments, robots, and lesson plans to classrooms to find out what these kids think of coding, how they build a sequence of actions, and how coding can help them express themselves and be more creative and independent.

After creating a simple coding environment with the most basic commands we took it to multiple summer camps, different classrooms and virtual co-design workshops.

We continually refined the coding environment based on the feedback we received from the kids and *every* feature in Weavly was either created or refined through this process.

Overall, from working directly with kids, we have learned and are learning about the importance of creating a customizable and simplifiable coding environment that each kid can enjoy the way they prefer.
