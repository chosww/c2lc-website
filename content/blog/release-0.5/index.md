# Release 0.5 of the Inclusive Coding Environment

We are excited to share [version 0.5 of the Inclusive Coding Environment](https://build.codelearncreate.org/)!

This release includes significant new features and refinements of some previous ones:

- **New movement and turning commands** - You can move forward one, two, or three steps, or also turn 45, 90, or 180 degrees, using a single command. The screenshot below shows a total of nine movement commands:

- **Save and share work** - While modifying your program, the URL being used by your web browser will be updated with information regarding your character's position, direction, and paths that have been drawn. This URL can be easily copied to your clipboard by clicking the Share button. Whenever you visit this URL, all your work will be recreated!

- **Character position and actions are sonified** - Additional work on sonification features mean the software provides cues about your character's horizontal and vertical movements, as well as different sounds as scene boundaries are approached.

- **Program speed control** - A speed slider control can now be found right below the play button. Four speed options allow the character to move faster while also affecting the rate at which sounds are played.

- **Themes** - Finally, we made changes that will let us theme the coding environment in different ways. Currently two new themes are available -- a [space theme](https://space.codelearncreate.org/) and a [forest theme](https://forest.codelearncreate.org/).

Please visit [build.codelearncreate.org](https://build.codelearncreate.org/) or any of the scene URLs above to try out these changes!
